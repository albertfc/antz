Antz is the firmware for the Ants analog semi-modular synthesizer from Plankton
Electronics (http://www.planktonelectronics.com/)

Currently Antz implements the MIDI to CV feature. You can connect any MIDI
keyboard, sequencer or computer and it transforms the digital signal to analog
voltages for controlling the synth.

The code is designed to run in a Atmel AVR atmega328p, but easily should run in
any other AVR device with few modifications.

Standard MIDI messages supported:
* 1000 -- Note off
* 1001 -- Note on (Note off with velocity = 0)
* 1110 -- Pitch Bend
* 1011 -- Control Change
  - Portamento/glide duration in cents of a second.
  - All notes off
  - Registered paramters
      0x0000 - Pitch bend sensitivity in semitones at MSB and 1/128 semitones at LSB.

Compilation and upload
======================
$ ./configure --host=avr
prepares code to be compiled on your system.

$ make
compiles everything.

$ make upload
uploads program to an AVR MCU using 'avrdude'.

$ ./configure --help
lists available compile time options.
